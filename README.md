In this project I focused on global COVID-19 data during 2020-2022 according to the following Dataset: 
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

By having two tables (one huge file was divided into two: Vaccinations and Deaths), I was able to see 
the correlations in the data when it came to certain countries and timeframes. 

I hope you enjoy my data exploration.
