## Data exploration in SQL using Covid Data

In this project I focused on global __COVID-19 data during 2020-2022__ according to this [Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By having two tables (one huge file was divided into two: _Vaccinations_ and _Deaths_), I was able to see the correlations in the data when it came to certain countries and timeframes. 

I hope you enjoy my Data Exploration!
